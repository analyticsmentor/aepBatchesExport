There are two ways to export a failed batch and really look into. By looking at the failed batch, you will understand how your entire xdm looked like when a request failed. 
This will help you pin point to what it could have caused it. 

Approach #1:
1. Export all the failed batches for a particular data set by using the catalog batches api: https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/catalog/batches?dataSet=<data set id>&limit=20&orderBy=asc:id
2. Now, take any batch id and use it to export the batch: https://platform-va7.adobe.io/data/foundation/export/batches/01JXAN25CKVAJSWSBT4W6544FT/failed
3. Now, make a request to the location you have received: https://platform-va7.adobe.io:443/data/foundation/export/batches/<batch id>/failed?path=<path name>.ndjson

Approach #2:
1. Identify the Æ’ailed batch the in the AEP data set UI itself. Grab the batch it.
2. Repeat step 2 from approach 1. https://platform-va7.adobe.io/data/foundation/export/batches/01JXAN25CKVAJSWSBT4W6544FT/failed
3. Now, make a request to the location you have received: https://platform-va7.adobe.io:443/data/foundation/export/batches/<batch id>/failed?path=<path name>.ndjson
